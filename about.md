<h4> I am Prince Jain </h4>

I graduated from NIT Jaipur as an Electrical Engineer but the desire to be associated with technology led me to join Oracle as a software developer. There I helped build the first version of the [Data Governance Studio](http://www.oracle.com/us/industries/financial-services/ds-ofs-dgrr-3714726.pdf) product. I got a chance to hone my coding skills (which even helped my build this website)

I eventually (and thankfully quickly) realised I was intrigued more by other parts of the business and product than just the engineering and also due to some well placed FOMO, I took the plunge and joined a full time MBA program at FMS Delhi. 
There I wanted to explore the various amazing career options presented before settling in one.
Joined Citibank as a Finance Intern in their [Treasury & Trade Solutions](https://www.citibank.com/tts]department) department. There I got a chance to work with so-and-so's of the banking world. Figured finance is not for me.
I also tried my hands in a lot of corporate competitions during my MBA tenure, highlight being getting a chance to present my idea on National Television and winning 5-lacs in  Reckitt Benckiser's Case Competition.

Thankfully I circled back on technology and chose Product Management as the choice of career and joined Paytm as a Product Manager post graduation and have been working on the "Paytm Mini Apps Store" since then.

I have worked on as a software developer, tried my hands in Finance, Marketing, Strategy and now the good-bad and ugly (mostly good!) of Product, and thankfully thoroughly enjoying the stuff I do on a day-to-day basis.

 **I have had the chance to present my ideas at two large public forums uptil now :**
